# Control-Motor-with-Joystick
This module is to show how to build an Arduino circuit with a SN754410 in order to make a motor move forward or backward controlled by a Play Station Joystick. I've added a servo motor to prototype a wheels direction. 
DC Motor and servo are both controlled by the same joytsick.
